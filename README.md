# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-ML
The task is to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections.
Goal
In this nortebook we will explore following tasks & topics:

Data Load using tensorflow
Data Exploration (Categorical and Nuemrical features)
Numerical data distribution (applying zscore)
Convert categorical data to numerical values
Data split (training set and test set)
Creation of Tensorflow Sequential model
